## Heart-Disease-Predictor
INTRODUCTION:
There is enormous progress in keeping the record of human health electronically by healthcare facilities and in this, perfection is a priority. Now, as the data is huge it is not possible for healthcare providers to use the information efficiently and this is where artificial intelligence is realized to be exceptionally effective.
Heart diseases are one of the most common diseases out there which are accountable for >80% of deaths. So, if these diseases can be predicted well in advance, they can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
Besides, this low cost model will cut down on a lot of expenses that would have otherwise been spent on various heart disease testing. Whereas, with this, the user just needs to fill in the form to get the result without having to spend on any tests.
Note: The scope of our model is upto predicting, if the user has got any heart disease or not, but doesn‟t particularly tell about which heart disease.

ALGORITHMS APPLIED: 
In this project we‟ve used supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the possibility of a heart disease. We have used the hear.csv dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository . This dataset has a total of 14 attributes Hence this research work also intended to use only the 14 attributes. 
The various attributes and their description are as follows:
